OVERALL IDEAS: 

I think we should extend each map by adding another grid (section) to each
seperate place, so when the character walks off the screen to one part they
arent immediately in an unknown area, but rather a familiar section. As a
result, there should be a progression for the maps that could be from 
TOWN-->FOREST-->SWAMP-->CAVES-->MOUNTAINS/DESERT-->RUINS-->VOLCANO-->FINAL
BOSS AREA. Maybe increase the difficulty of each puzzle/mob in each new
section to give off a better progression system? FOR SURE have a lot of
backround 


TOWN:

Maybe give off the comforting feeling of a town-y setting? Adding a windmill
towards the right side of the map could add some more charm. There a good
amount of trees, maybe add some diversity with a large oak tree
