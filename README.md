Mckay -- I had gemini add comments to every line of code to help you guys understand whats going on with the server, remember we aren't using std namespace so you need to prefix stuff like std::cout
I also seperated logic into multiple files now so it's easier to make edits as a team
If you need anything explained or need help just ask me



 ----   TODOS   ---- will update this later and assign tasks

 yousaf - dialogue -- write out what npcs are going to say and label whos saying it, determine which npcs will give quests as well. also name the npcs as you wish
