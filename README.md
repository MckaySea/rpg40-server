Mckay -- I had gemini add comments to every line of code to help you guys understand whats going on with the server, remember we aren't using std namespace so you need to prefix stuff like std::cout
I also seperated logic into multiple files now so it's easier to make edits as a team
If you need anything explained or need help just ask me
